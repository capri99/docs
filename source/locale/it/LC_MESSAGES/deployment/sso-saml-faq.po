msgid "How to Bind Authentication to Id Attribute instead of Email"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:7
msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can use an Id Attribute instead of email to bind the "
"user.  We recommend choosing an ID that is unique and will not change "
"over time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:9
msgid ""
"Configuring with an Id Attribute allows you to reuse an email address for"
" a new user without the old user's information being exposed. For "
"instance, if a user with an email address joe.smith@mattermost.com was "
"once an employee, a new employee named Joe Smith can use the same email. "
"This configuration is also useful when a user's name changes and their "
"email needs to be updated."

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:11
msgid ""
"This process was designed with backwards compatibility to email binding. "
"Here is the process applied to new account creations and to accounts "
"logging in after the configuration:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:13
msgid ""
"A user authenticated with SAML is bound to the SAML service user using "
"the Id Attribute (as long as it has been configured) or bound by email "
"using the email received from SAML."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:14
msgid ""
"When the user tries to login and the SAML server responds with a valid "
"authentication, then the server uses the \"Id\" field of the SAML "
"authentication to search the user."

msgid "If a user bound to that ID already exists, it logs in as that user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:16
msgid ""
"If a user bound to that ID does not exist, it will search base on the "
"email."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a user bound to the email exists, it logs in with email and updates "
"the autentication data to the ID, instead of the email."

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:18
msgid ""
"If a user bound to the ID or email does not exist, it will create a new "
"Mattermost account bound to the SAML account by ID and will allow the "
"user to log in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:20
msgid "Note:  Existing accounts will not update until they log in to the server."

"Can SAML via Microsoft ADFS be configured with Integrated Windows "
"Authentication (IWA)?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:25
msgid ""
"Yes. IWA is supported on the browser, with support added to iOS and "
"Android mobile apps in Q2/2019 (mobile apps v1.18 and later)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:27
msgid ""
"However, IWA is not supported on the Mattermost Desktop Apps due to a "
"limitation in Electron. As a workaround you may create a browser desktop "
"shortcut for quick access to Mattermost, just like a Desktop App."

"How do I migrate users from one authentication method (e.g. email) to "
"SAML?"

msgid "How is SAML different from OAuth 2.0 and OpenId Connect?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:37
msgid ""
"OAuth 2.0 was primarily intended for delegated authorization, where an "
"app is authorized to access resources, such as Google contact list. It "
"doesnâ€™t deal with authentication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:39
msgid ""
"OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, which supports "
"authentication and thus direct SSO."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml-faq.rst:41
msgid ""
"SAML is like OpenID Connect, except typically used in enterprise "
"settings. OpenID Connect is more common in consumer websites and "
"web/mobile apps."
