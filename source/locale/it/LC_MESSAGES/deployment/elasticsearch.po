"Elasticsearch allows you to search large volumes of data quickly, in near"
" real time, by creating and managing an index of post data. The indexing "
"process can be managed from the System Console after setting up and "
"connecting an Elasticsearch server. The post index is stored on the "
"Elasticsearch server and is updated constantly after new posts are made. "
"In order to index existing posts, a bulk index of the entire post "
"database must be generated."

msgid ""
"The 25,000 messages are spread out over a long time window, and the "
"``BulkIndexingTimeWindowSeconds`` configuration value is too low for "
"efficient indexing of such a \"sparse\" database. The value of that "
"config should ideally be set so that the median number of posts falling "
"within any period of that time in the database is around 700 to 800. The "
"default value is 1 hour, so if you are doing a lot less than 800 posts an"
" hour on average, then the indexing will be much slower in terms of "
