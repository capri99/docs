"If the import is interrupted for any reason, it continues from where it "
"left off the next time you run it. You can run the command repeatedly "
"with the same data file, and the data is imported only once. From v5.20, "
"posts with matching timestamps to incoming posts will have their "
"attachments replaced by the incoming data. Prior to v5.20 any updates to "
"posts with matching timestamps were appended to older posts."
