"Mattermost can be configured to act as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider. The "
"SAML Single-Sign-On integration offers the following benefits:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:7
msgid ""
"**Single-sign-on.** Users can sign-in to Mattermost with their SAML "
"credentials."

"In addition to the officially supported identity providers, you can also "
"configure SAML for a custom IdP. For instance, customers have "
