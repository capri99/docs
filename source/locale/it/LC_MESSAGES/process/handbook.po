"**Open source** means that by default we make our technology, business "
"process and source code available to the public. We develop a small "
"portion as proprietary technology, built upon our open source work, to "
"license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source "
"work to be produced. Since the start of the Mattermost open source "
"project in 2015, we have used this model to develop effective open source"
" solutions for the world to use. This model is sometimes called `Thin "
"Open Core <https://medium.com/open-consensus/2-open-core-definition-"
"examples-tradeoffs-e4d0c044da7c>`_."

"**Remote-first** means that by default our staff works anywhere in the "
"world where a) we have support for quality video calling and b) where we "
"can work in a legally appropriate environment. Mattermost was born in an "
"extraordinary age where organizations can attract, hire and enable remote"
" teams--working from homes, coffee shops and co-working spaces across "
"timezones--to produce better technology and business results in less time"
" than purely office-based teams, while maintaining security and "
"compliance standards."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/process/handbook.rst:47
msgid ""
"Remote-first culture flourishes when we share one simple principle: "
"**Courtesy**. Courtesy means Mattermosters are thoughtful about keeping "
"our communities appropriately informed, following etiquette for "
"discussions, calls and video meetings, and giving and receiving feedback "
"on how to work better together. Courtesy also means we gladly accommodate"
" those who prefer to work out of a dedicated office. We are remote-first,"
" not remote-only."

#: ../../source/process/handbook.rst:49
msgid ""
"**Communities-centered** means we define our success in the context of "
"the success of our `communities <https://docs.mattermost.com/process"
"/community-overview.html>`_: users, customers, implementers, resellers, "
"technology partners, contributors, and colleagues. The success of each "
"community is owned by a member of the Mattermost leadership team. The "
"plural definition of \"communities\" is intended to avoid unconsciously "
"marginalizing downstream stakeholders."

"**Based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet** "
"means the mailing address for Mattermost, Inc. is in Palo Alto, "
"California, and our headquarters is on the internet, specifically the "
"production-quality Mattermost instance at "

"Mattermost staff work with our communities of colleagues, users, "
"partners, customers, candidates, contributors and other `community "
"members <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html>`_ "

"\"Commuters\"."
