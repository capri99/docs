"**Markdown**: Mattermost supports the use of `Markdown. "

"**Hashtags**: Use hashtags to make your Zapier posts searchable. Use "

" ticket instantly searchable by clicking the hashtag."

"**Quick Links**: Link back to the service that fired the zap through the "
"use of Markdown `embedded links "
