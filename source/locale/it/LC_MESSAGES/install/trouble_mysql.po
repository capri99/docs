"Before you can run the Mattermost server, you must first install and "
"configure a database. You can start Mattermost by navigating to the "
"``/opt/mattermost/bin`` directory and entering the command ``sudo -u "
"mattermost ./platform``. If the Mattermost server cannot connect to the "
"database, it will fail to start. This section deals with MySQL database "
"issues that you may encounter when you start up Mattermost for the first "
"time."

"How you install MySQL varies depending upon which Linux distribution you "
"use. However, once MySQL is installed, the configuration instructions are"
" the same. For all distributions you must create a ``mattermost`` "
"database and a ``mattermost`` database user. Failure to create these "
"database objects or improperly referencing them from the Mattermost "
"configuration file, ``/opt/mattermost/config/config.json``, causes "
"Mattermost to fail. The troubleshooting tips given here deal with these "
"specific issues."
