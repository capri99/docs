"In some scenarios, you may wish to use Mattermost behind a proxy. This "
"can be used to do things such as monitoring outbound traffic from "
"Mattermost or controlling which websites can appear in link previews and "
"other embedded content. If you only want to use a proxy for images, the "
"`image proxy <../administration/image-proxy.rst>`_ is also an option."

"Mattermost's use of a proxy is configured using the ``HTTP_PROXY``, "
"``HTTPS_PROXY`` and ``NO_PROXY`` environment variables."

"The ``HTTP_PROXY`` and ``HTTPS_PROXY`` environment variables store the "
"address of the proxy server for HTTP and HTTPS requests respectively. "
"This value should include the protocol and port of the proxy such as "
"``http://192.168.4.5:3128``."

"If you wish to have Mattermost authenticate with your proxy, it supports "

"Note that when proxying HTTPS resources, you will need to configure your "
"Mattermost server with the root certificate of the proxy. Otherwise, "
"Mattermost will refuse any response from the proxy as it will detect that"
" its connection has been intercepted."

"The ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable can be set to prevent certain "
"requests from going through the proxy, such as to an SSO provider (e.g. "
"GitLab or SAML) or intranet sites that should be accessible in link "
"previews. It can be configured as a set of comma-separated IP addresses "
"(e.g. ``1.2.3.4``), IP address ranges specified in CIDR notation (e.g. "
"``1.2.3.4/8``), or domain names. An IP address or domain name can also "
"include a port number."

"When a domain name is specified, the domain and all of its subdomains are"
" matched, however a domain name with a leading ``.`` only matches the "
"subdomains. For example, ``example.com`` matches both ``example.com`` and"
" ``sub.example.com`` while ``.example.com`` only matches the latter."
