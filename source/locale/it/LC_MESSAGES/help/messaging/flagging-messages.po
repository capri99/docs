"One way we like to use flags is to mark messages we want to respond to "
"later. It's useful when someone asks for something that requires work. We"
" flag the post, keep doing what we're doing, and then go back to our list"
" of flagged posts. After the work is completed, we can reply back to the "
"post and unflag it to clear it from the list."
