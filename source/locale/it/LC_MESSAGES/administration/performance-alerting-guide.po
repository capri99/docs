"CPU Utilization Rate is fairly straightforward. CPU Utilization Rate "
"tracks the CPU usage of the app servers as a percentage. The maximum "
"percentage is based on the number of CPU cores or vCPUs your app server "
"has. For example, if you have four CPU cores and your app server was at "
"100% utilization rate on all four cores, the graph would show 400% for "
"that app server."

"It’s best to set the alert threshold based on your average CPU "
"utilization and how many cores/vCPUs your app servers have. Take a look "
"at the chart over the last seven days. You’ll want to set the threshold "
"somewhere between your maximum CPU usage (cores * 100) and the CPU usage "
"you see. The lower you set the threshold, the more alerts, and therefore "
"the more false positives, you will get. Set the threshold too high and "
"you may not receive an alert for an incident until it’s gotten worse. The"
" same principle applies to all alerts, regardless of the chart."

"Goroutines are functions or methods that run concurrently with other "

"Any 4xx or 5xx HTTP response status codes are counted as a REST API "
"error. API errors themselves are not necessarily a problem. There are "
"many legitimate reasons for an API error to occur, such as users’ "
"sessions expiring or clients requesting to see if a resource exists and "

"API errors that scale with your installation base."

"That said, errors against the REST API can be indicative of deployment "
"and other issues. For example, if one of your app servers did not deploy "
"correctly for whatever reason, it may begin returning a high number of "
"API errors. Another example would be a rogue bot spamming the API with "
"bad requests. Alerts on API errors per second would help catch these and "

"The Mean API Request Time is the average amount of time a REST API "
