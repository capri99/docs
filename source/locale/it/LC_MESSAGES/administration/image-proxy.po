"Using an image proxy means that all requests for images made by "
"Mattermost clients will go through the proxy instead of contacting third-"
"party servers directly. This helps protect user privacy by preventing "
"third-party servers from tracking who views an image. This also prevents "
"the use of tracking pixels (invisible images that do the same thing "
"without the user even seeing an image)."

"Certain proxy servers also provide a layer of caching which can make "
"loading images faster and more reliable. This caching also helps preserve"
" posts by protecting them from dead images."

"Mattermost clients will use the image proxy to load all external images. "
"The Mattermost server will use the image proxy when possible, but will "
"not use it when requesting content that may not be an image, such as for "
"`image previews of plaintext URLs <https://github.com/mattermost"

"The local image proxy is available as part of the Mattermost server "
"deployment. When using the local image proxy, images are served to "
"clients through the server which helps anonymize users. If SSL is enabled"
" on the server, it provides a secure connection. This method does not "
"offer any caching behavior."

"With the local image proxy enabled, requests for images hosted on the "

"untrusted-internal-connections-to>`_ for more information or if you are "

"The `atmos/camo <https://github.com/atmos/camo>`_ image proxy is a "
"standalone image proxy that can be deployed separately from the "
"Mattermost server. It provides additional configuration options over the "
"built-in image proxy, and it can also be used if isolation between the "
"Mattermost server and image proxy is desired."

"Once you've deployed an ``atmos/camo`` (https://github.com/atmos/camo) "
"instance, you must specify the **Remote Image Proxy URL** and **Remote "

"``CAMO_KEY`` environment variable used when setting up the image proxy."
