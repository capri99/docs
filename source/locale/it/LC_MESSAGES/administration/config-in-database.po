"A new configuration option was added in `5.10 release "
"<https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/changelog.html#configuration-"
"in-database>`_ to use the database as the single source of truth for the "
"active configuration of your Mattermost installation. This will change "
"the Mattermost binary from reading the default config.json file to "
"reading the configuration settings stored within a configuration table in"
" the database."
