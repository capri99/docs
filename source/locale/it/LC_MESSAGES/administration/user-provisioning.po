"There are currently three recommended user provisioning workflows in "

#: ../../source/administration/user-provisioning.rst:13
msgid ""
"**On demand:** If user accounts are not pre-provisioned using one of the "
"methods described below, then a new user account will be provisioned when"
" the user first logs in. When the user logs in, they are asked to select "
"a public team to join (all users must belong to at least one team) and "
"then they are added automatically to Town Square and Off-Topic channels. "
"Mattermost also has a default channel setting that allows everyone to be "
"added to additional channels specified by the organization."

"**Pre-provisioned via bulk import:** Mattermost features a `bulk data "
"loading tool <https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/bulk-"
"loading.html>`__ that can be used for pre-provisioning new users by "
"adding them to teams and channels before their first login to Mattermost."
" This tool automates the creation of Teams, Channels, Users and Posts "
"(with file attachments). It can also be used to migrate users and content"
" from an existing system."

"**Mattermost API:** The Mattermost `RESTful API "
"<https://api.mattermost.com>`__ can be used to pre-provision new user "
