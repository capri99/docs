"At its core, Mattermost is a single-compiled Go binary that is exposed as"
" a Restful JSON web server with Javascript and Go clients. See the "
"Restful API docs `here <https://api.mattermost.com>`__."

"It is configured using `config/config.json "
"<https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html>`__ and "
"provides the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/overview/architecture.rst:16
msgid ""
"**Authentication client**, which provides the functionality for users to "
"log into Mattermost via email address and password in Team Edition. "
"Enterprise E10 adds the ability for users to authenticate using Active "
"Directory or LDAP, and Enterprise E20 adds the ability to authenticate "
"using SAML SSO providers like ADFS, OneLogin and Okta."

"The Mattermost `hosted push notification service "

msgid ""
"A proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that "
"acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from "
"other servers. Mattermost recommends using a proxy in front of Mattermost"
" to increase security, performance and the ability to monitor and shape "
"traffic connecting to Mattermost:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/overview/architecture.rst:35
msgid ""
"**Security**: A proxy server can manage Secure Socket Layer (TLS/SSL) "
"encryption and set policy on how network traffic will be routed to the "
"Mattermost server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/overview/architecture.rst:36
msgid ""
"**Performance**: In a high availability configuration, the proxy server "
"balances the network load across multiple Mattermost servers for "
"optimized performance. A hardware proxy with dedicated devices for "
"processing SSL encryption and decryption can also be used to increase "
"performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/overview/architecture.rst:37
msgid ""
"**Monitoring**: A proxy server can monitor connection traffic and record "
"traffic in standard audit logs that common monitoring tools like Kibana "
"and Splunk can consume and report on. Some of the events that can be "
"captured include file uploads and downloads, which are not tracked by the"
" Mattermost Server logging process."

"HTTPS is a secure, encrypted protocol and is highly recommended for "

"If a WSS connection is not available and HTTPS is substituted, the system"
" will appear to work but real-time updates and notifications will not. In"
" this mode of operation, updates will only appear on a page refresh. WSS "
"has a persistent connection to the Mattermost Server when a client is "
"connected, while HTTPS has an intermittent connection and only connects "
"to the server when a page or file is requested."
