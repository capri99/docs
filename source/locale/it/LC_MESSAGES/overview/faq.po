"wide, general purpose messenger, that isn't optimized for large DevOps "

"need - specifically for DevOps. People want support for Linux and Mac "

"release security update patches when reports of new attacks are received "

"released before publicly detailing its nature, so that users and "
"customers can upgrade before the security vulnerability is widely known. "
