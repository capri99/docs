"**Mattermost Team Edition** is an open source, private cloud workplace "
"messaging solution designed for deployment by non-technical users with "
"basic IT skills. Combined with native Mattermost apps on mobile and "
"desktop, it brings all your team communication to one place, with web, "
"mobile and PC interfaces, continuous archiving, instant search and a host"
" of 3rd party integrations. It deploys as a single Linux binary under MIT"
" license, with either MySQL or PostgreSQL as a database, with a host of "
"simple, automated deployment options created by our community."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:14
msgid ""
"The project was `created by a video game company "
"<https://www.mattermost.org/why-we-made-mattermost-an-open-source-slack-"
"alternative/>`__ who previously used a proprietary, SaaS-based messenger "
"which was bought by a big company and neglected. The SaaS messenger "
"started having outages, it crashed, it lost files, and export didn't "
"work. When they stopped their subscription, the SaaS messenger paywalled "
"them from their own data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:16
msgid ""
"Lesson learned, the company started using messaging software they'd "
"developed for their video game players, and eventually open sourced the "
"software in 2015. The software became surprisingly popular and eventually"
" the company left the video game business, renamed itself \"Mattermost, "
"Inc.\" and shifted focus to expanding the open source project, funded by "
"creating commercial Enterprise Edition extensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:18
msgid ""
"Because of how we started, we're committed to never allowing commercial "
"versions of Mattermost to lock in a user's data--organizations using "
"Mattermost must always have full access to their information and be able "
"to downgrade to the open source version."

"The following stewardship principles for our open source work helps keep "
"our intent and purpose clear:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:28
msgid "1. Never locked-in"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:30
msgid ""
"Mattermost software, whether open source or commercial, should never "
"withhold an organization's data from the organization. Commercial "
"versions of Mattermost should always have a path to downgrade to the open"
" source version without loss of access to data."

msgid "2. Quick Time-to-Value"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:35
msgid ""
"Great software creates value quickly. A non-technical user with basic IT "
"skills should be able to set up Team Edition, understand every feature in"
" the UI, and roll out the product and increase team productivity in just "
"a few minutes. We should automate as much as possible in a standard "
"install, ask few technical questions, and provide full explanations for "
"any decisions that need to be made."

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:38
msgid "3. Minimalist"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:40
msgid ""
"Minimalism is providing the correct amount of functionality and not more "
"and not less. Great design is about doing important things extremely "
"well, and not many things poorly. Make features work well for their "
"intended purpose before adding new features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:43
msgid "4. Decisions not options"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:45
msgid ""
"Make decisions instead of providing options. Every time you present an "
"option, you force the user to make a decision which can lead to "
"frustration if it's not for the majority of users."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer/manifesto.rst:55

"Users should never run into anything unexpected with Mattermost. We ship "
