"*Responsive* means when a user clicks, taps, types or otherwise enters "

"There is no such thing as \"user error\"--it’s always our fault as "
"product designers. We prevent problems of incorrect usage by making users"

"things go wrong–for example, adding undelete, undo and rolling back."

"When our product is correct, users are never confused. Everything we do--"
